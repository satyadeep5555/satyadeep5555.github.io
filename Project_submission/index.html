                        The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is a place that brings motivated students,
                        professors, and professionals together. We train high-quality students to become problem
                        solvers.
                        Our
                        majors are active and engaged in campus life. Students clubs such as Math Club, Computer Science
                        Club
                        and Engineering Club are among the most active on campus. This allows us to provide exceptional
                        future
                        prospects to all those who study with us or collaborate with us.

                        <p>An annual outreach program to encourage young women to explore mathematics-related careers.
                            The
                            event
                            offers mathematics activities for young women via hands-on workshops and a career panel for
                            question
                            & answer. Sponsored by the department and other AUM offices. The Sonia Kovalevsky

                            High
                            School Day is an annualprogram of mathematics activities for young women. Sponsored by the
                            Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) and Auburn Montgomery's Department of Mathematics
                            and
                            Computer Sciences, it is named in honor of Sonia Kovalevsky, who was the first woman to earn
                            a
                            doctorate in mathematics in 1874. The event is designed toencourage high school-aged women
                            to
                            consider careers in mathematics and the sciences. Sonia Kovalevsky Days have been organized
                            by
                            AWM
                            and institutions around the country since 1985. It is generally held at AUM during the

                        <strong> Computer Arts and Animation Summer Course </strong>
                        <p>
                            AUM has developed a major interactive computer arts training system that applies
                            Computational
                            Thinking (CT) with geometrical methods in visual art skill development for young learners.
                            The
                            short
                            course is a great start for students interested in animation and development

                Activities include robotics, radio control plane, etc. Some members are also members of the Math or
                Computer clubs. The club has an engineering lab. Students use the lab to perform experiments. The lab
                also houses a Biodiesel system. The system can convert waste cooking oil to biodiesel fuel. There is an
                annual engineering competition open to students registered in the “Introduction to Engineering” class.
                WindTurbine, electric motor bike, robotic arms, etc. are some past competition projects.
