                    <div>Computer Science degree program is a relatively new discipline. The first such a program in the
                        United
                        States began in the 60&#39;s. In general, it is a science of using computers to solve problems.
                        It
                        is
                        not about using software. With the advent of multicore systems, improvements in performance will
                        depend
                        on the effective use of parallelism. High Performance Computing is the main theme of this degree
                        program. In addition to obtaining general computer science training, you will learn multicore
                        architectures and programming. This is one of the hot new hardware and software developers
                        jobs.<br />

                    <div>The vigorous mathematical training allows you to take a problem, identify its essential
                        features,
                        and
                        study or characterize them further. It has become a great tool for a variety of jobs.
                        Professional
                        schools such as medical school, law school, and pharmacy school often give priority to
                        prospective
                        students who have an undergraduate degree in mathematics. Our program gives you the unique
                        opportunity
                        to work closely with caring professors who are also leading researchers in their fields and have
                        opportunities for you to get involved in their research.<br />
